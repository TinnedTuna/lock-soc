# LockSoc Recommended Reading

Many of these deal with many aspects of physical security, from locks and 
safes, to the psychological and human aspects of creating and implementing
secure systems.

Unfortunately, many of these resources are hard to acquire, they don't seem
to exist in any meaningful sense on Amazon, and they don't appear in our
library. 

## Society Loans 

As a rule, the LockSoc does not keep copies of the documents on this list, and
cannot loan them out.

However, some of the membership does have privately-held copies. If you're 
interested in one of the harder-to-find or expensive resources, ask around.
Please bear in mind that some of these documents are hard to come by or simply
very expensive or bulky.

## Locks

These primarily cover the workings and attack strategies of many existing kinds
of locks.

### MIT Guide to Lock picking

  * Author: Ted the Tool
  * Type: Introductory Guide
  * Length: 49 pages
  * Common Format: PDF file
  * Availability: Web Search

This is also sometimes referred to as "The Document Which Used to be Called The
MIT Guide To Lock Picking"

It describes the operational principles of pin-tumbler locks, and the defects
which lead to it's failure. Towards the end, the guide covers security pens,
master keys and even simple wafer locks.

It is short (49 pages, several of which are large diagrams), and has very good 
diagrams, and as such makes for an excellent starting point.

It can often be turned up by a simple web search, but many members have a copy.

## Safes

Safes and vaults hold intrigue, but actually, many of them use common, simple
locking mechanisms, and fall prey to simple attacks.

### Safecracking for the Computer Scientist

  * Author: Matt Blaze
  * Type: Introductory Guide
  * Length: 34 pages
  * Common Format: PDF File
  * Availability: Web Search

This short overview provides a whirl-wind tour of safecracking. It's main focus
is simple rotary combination lock safes, with some additional security features
(for example, re-lockers). It covers manipulation attacks, brute-force and 
drilling, and mentions common methods of defense against such attacks.

It's list of references is very illuminating, and worth having a look.

## Operational Security

The design and operation of a secure system is extremely difficult, and must 
take into account many factors, such as human psychology, cryptography, and,
of course, physical security. These resources give a treatment to the workings
of such systems.

### The NSA Security Manual

  * Author: Undisclosed
  * Type: Institutional Guidelines
  * Length: 16 pages
  * Common Format: PDF file
  * Availability: Web Search, see below also.

Leaked sometime ago by an anonymous source at the National Security Agency, the
guide covers many aspects of the day-to-day requirements of working at the 
agency, for example, badges must be worn at all times, and how to answer 
questions from the public as to the job.

It provides an interesting insight into how operational security affects 
personel "on the ground" in an area that's long been clandestine and very
cloak & dagger.

The manual can be [found](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/nsaman.pdf) on 
Ross Anderson's webpages.

### Security Engineering

  * Author: Ross Anderson
  * Type: Book (Tome)
  * Length: 1040 pages
  * Common Format: Book
  * Availability: Amazon, Individual Chapers Online

Written in 1998, and updated in 2008, Ross Anderson's Security Engineering 
gives a solid treatment to it's namesake. It concerns itself with security
as a process to be applied to an institution.

Security Engineering provides several insights, as well as case studies from
Nuclear Command & Control, Banking & Book-keeping, and other systems commonly
expected to be "high security".

Ross has convinced his publisher to allow all of the chapters to be posted 
individually on [the book's website](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html)

# Locks, Safes, and Security: An International Police Reference

  * Author: Marc Weber Tobias
  * Type: Book (Tome)

This book is alleged to be an extremely good reference on the security of it's

in excess of Â£100, and the publisher offers a hardback copy at over $219.95.

please share!
