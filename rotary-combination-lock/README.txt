# Rotary Combination Lock

A rotary combination lock that's designed to be 3D printed, but I don't see why 
the plans couldn't be used in a different manfuacturing process.

It's purpose is purely demonstrative. I want a nice, clear way to demonstrate t
the operating principles of a rotary combination lock.

The license is BSD-style. The tl;dr is do almost what you want, as long as I 
retain credit.
